This work deals with building a secure off-chain log for applications that utilize the blockchain. We build a low cost off-chain log for high volume data which is provably secure based on digests stored on the blockchain. WedgeDB also creates a incentive and punishment mechanism utilizing a smart contract deployed on the blockchain to ensure that clients and the off-chain log don't maliciously write or manipulate data stored in the log.
