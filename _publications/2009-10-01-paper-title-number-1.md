This work deals with performing efficient read-only transactions. The context of this work involves a network comprising of clusters of nodes. Each cluster stores data 'owned' by the cluster. Consider a cluster A, B and C with each of them having 3<i>f<i>+1 nodes, where <i>f<i> is the number of faults that can be tolerated by a cluster (<i>f<i> can be defined by a cluster independent of it's value for other clusters). In order for A to read data from B and C, A needs to know that the data it has read from B and C is the freshest copy and it is consistent. The problem we wish to solve is to allow A to read from a globally consistent snapshot even when it is reading from different clusters.
